The QA-Recorder is a [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/) app built with [Electron](https://github.com/electron)and [Electron-Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge).
It assists with the launching and management of [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) with the purpose of recording gameplay of QA testers for games.
It also helps developers review the recorded footage and see the bugs that QA testers encounter.
